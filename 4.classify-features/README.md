# 3. Classify Features

In this module, we present our pipeline for classifying features.

### Feature Classification



## Step 1: Setup Feature Classification Environment

### Step 1a: Create Feature Classification Environment

```sh
# Run this command to create the conda environment for classifying features
conda env create -f 
```

### Step 1b: Activate Classification Environment

```sh
# Run this command to activate the conda environment for classifying features
conda activate 
```

## Step 2: Define File/Folder paths

Inside the notebook [preprocess-features.ipynb](preprocess-features.ipynb), the variables `DP_project_path` and `output_path` need to be changed the reflect the paths of the DeepProfiler project to load features/metadata from and the desired save location for normalized features output.
We used an external harddrive and therefore needed to use specific paths.

## Step 3: Classify Cell Health Features

```bash
# Run this script to classify Cell Health features
bash 
```
